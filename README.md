Welcome to the HotDoc Internship Take-home Assignment!

This take home assignment should not take more than **an hour!**

## Steps

### Step 1: Create Github Repository

First step of this assignment is to take this zip file, create a github repository, and push the code to it.

The repository should be on your personal github space.

### Step 2: Pick a language

We have two options for language, JavaScript and Ruby.

Neither option is easier, or taken with more weight. Just choose the language you are most comfortable with.

Please delete the test folder for the language you are *not* completing and commit those changes to your repository.

### Step 3: Do the 5 small challenges!

You'll find a folder called `tasks`. Each file is a small coding challenge, complete each. 

*Make sure to commit after solving each one*

There is a `tests` folder which you can run to verify your function is working.

### Step 4: Email us the result!

Simply push your changes and commits up to your repository and email us your repository.

We'll get back to you as soon as possible on next steps.

## FAQ

### Why a take-home assignment?

We use a take-home assignment because we feel it is the most equitable for applicants who may not perform well under pressure and applicants who cannot necessarily make a "9 to 5" interview time easily. 

### How long should this take?

This should not take more than an hour. 

### How do you ensure timing of the challenges?

We use the commits that you make to your github repository. We are mentioning this here to ensure that you commit often and ensure you have full transparency into the process.

### How do you ensure no one is cheating?

We run completed assignments through plagarism software.

### How is this assignment 'marked'?

We have 3 competencies that we mark against: Correctness, effectiveness of solution, and depth of knowledge.
